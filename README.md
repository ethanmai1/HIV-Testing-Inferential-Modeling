# HIV-Testing-Inferential-Modeling

Please check back later for code; it will be published soon!

## Background

According to a 2018 UNAIDS report, HIV prevalence was estimated at 20.7% among men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) in Mexico; the most affected regions were identified in the Southernmost part of the country sharing border with Guatemala. The report also showed that there has been an increase in AIDS-related deaths since 2010 of 133% in Guatemala versus 3% in Mexico. Migration routes have been identified as important corridors of disease transmission, and there is evidence that border regions may be one of the first places new HIV subtypes will be identified. Testing is also required for the treatment cascade (WHO).Â³ It has been previously hypothesized that MSM who are comfortable with their sex identity, sexual orientation and additional social network factors related to positive mental health may have a favorable effect on HIV testing, thus leading to increased HIV testing and potentially decreased transmission.

Cruzando Fronteras is a study with a goal to explore the context of rising drug use along the Mexico/Guatemala border and define its relationship to the local epidemiology and phylo-geography of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It was conducted from 2010-2015; however, the dataset used in this analysis is from 2014-2015. Our focus is on the group of MSM surveyed during this time period.

## Project Description

Question of interest: What sociodemographic and clinical variables are associated with having ever been tested for HIV among men-who-have-sex with men (MSM) on the Mexico/Guatemala border?

We are interested in applying logistic regression to the data collected from Cruzando Fronteras for the inference of possible correlates to HIV testing. Backward selection is applied to arrive at an inferential model of statistically significant variables.
